# OPEN SOURCE INTELLIGENCE GATHERING FINAL PROJECT 

"If I had 8 hours to chop down a tree, I would spend 6 sharpening the blade."

                -Abraham Lincoln
                
## Overview
Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the first, longest and arguably the most important part of a penetration test. It is basically all of the information that can be obtained from publicaly available sources. The information gathered, would then be used to determine possible vulnerabilities that could be exploited.  

When conducting an type of digital investigation, it is important to remember that there are two types of tools you may use- Passive and Active. Passive tools get their information in a way where the target was not touched, and where there is no trace/log of the activiy. Active tools will cross the boundry and actually penetrate the target. 

A bug bounty is something that is offered by websites, software develpers, or companies where individuals can recieve recognition and/or compensation for reporting bugs, exploits or vulnerabilities. The companies listed bellow were gathered from a bug bounty list which means they have given permission for people to test, hack, tweak and prod their site. 

## Part 1: The Project
What does all that mean to you? For your final project you need to pick one of the companies from the following list and evaluate their security posture.  You will need to use a combination of information (OSINT) gathering tools, vulnerability scanners, and vulnerability exploitation tools.  You will need to use the knowledge you have gained this year, and the following tools to complete this project. 

### Step 1: Pick a Company 
**Make sure to follow the specific instructions given to you by the company**

[Nintendo](https://firebounty.com/bug-bounty-program/762/nintendo)

[Boozt](https://firebounty.com/bug-bounty-program/706/boozt-fashion-ab)


### Step 2: Gather Information
1. [OSINT Framework](http://osintframework.com/) Start with this set of tools! This is the main site used which has most of the tools I used.
2. [Google hacking database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/)
3. Whois command (on linux)
  The syntax is very simple and is whois thewebsite.com
4. [Netcraft](https://searchdns.netcraft.com/)
5. Check public records
5. Check for job openings, linkedin profiles, social media profiles
6. DNS tools
7. Dig 

### Step 3: Scan fo Vulnerabilities 
8. Nessus web application scanner [nessus](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus)
9. Clone your website and look at it offline using [httrack](https://www.httrack.com/)
10. Burpsuite to scan for vulnerabilities [Burpsuite](https://portswigger.net/burp)


## Part 2: Presentation
From the information you have gathered, you now need to create a professional report detailing the information you found, the tools used, and your suggestions on how the company/business could improve their security posture. 

## Part 3: Due Date
This project is due the week of May 14th - 18th
